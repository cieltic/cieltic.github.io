		<h2>HunAliee in Wonderland</h2>
		<p>“HunAliee in Wonderland” is the name of my fan-art (fan-made art/comic/painting for stars) project, which includes comic, related goods, and the theme dolls. </p>

		<p>The whole series of the comic was inspired by the classic “Alice in Wonderland”. The name “HunAliee” was originated from <b>“Sehun Oh”</b>, the youngest member of Korean male singer group “EXO”.</p>

		<P> “Aliee” was the Korean name of “Alice”. Because there were nine members in EXO, I assigned each member a character corresponding in the original “Alice” story, but with their own personalities and charms. :) This is a comic about “HunAliee”, who occasionally dropped into a mysterious world, and then started his adventure there. In wonderland, he met all of his eight brothers and found that they were all very different from the way they used to be in the real world. So he decided to figure out what happened and help his brothers back to their original life. So basically even though my story was inspired by “Alice in Wonderland” and had a same topic with it, my story had its own plots and elements. </p>
		<P>Here’s some previews of my comic. I started to post them out in <a href="http://weibo.com/oohhaneul94">my Weibo</a> (Weibo is very similar to Twitter) since 3rd, August, 2015. And for every chapter of my comic I got more than 10,000 views.</p>

		<P>Then I just generated an idea, why didn’t I make “HunAliee” a real “little boy” that we could see and touch? I drew the draft of my “HunAliee” doll and contacted doll factory to make a sample for me. </P>

		<div class="doll">
		<img src="hunaliee/hunaliee1.jpg" width="80%">
		</div>

		<p>The first doll sample came out at 14th, August. I then made some suggestion about adjustment and then waited for the second doll sample. </p>

		</div>

		<p>The second doll sample was quite successful I thought. It was so adorable. I brought it to my family and friends and all of them liked it.</p>

		<p>Then I started to promote my “HunAliee” doll around 24th, August. I got more than 3000 reposts on that post and 1000 people ordering my dolls with a week.</p>

		<p>So far I have more than 2000 orders from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and America. I got 3,000 fans because of my fan-art and HunAliee. And the “HunAliee” doll had already finished producing. My family in China is now helping me to ship out the orders. :) </p>
		<p>I also prepared some special gifts to my customers.</p>

		<p>Last December, I designed some clothes for HunAliee and they were all sold out within a month.</p>

		<p>Part of the revenue from HunAliee projected was donated to people who needed help. In China, I chose "壹基金" (One Foundation), founded by <b>Jet Li</b> （famous Asian actor). I have two programs; the first one is to provide free food to the children who live in impoverished area, and the second one is a monthly plan to help poor people.</p>

		<p>Besides, I sponsored two kids via <a href="http://www.worldvision.org"> Worldvision</a>. </p>

		<p>The first kid is a girl, called Jea. She is from Philippines and is 10 years old. The second kid is a boy from Ethiopia. His name is Kyriya and is 6 years old right now. I hope my little help could help them to improve at least a little bit of their living condition. </p>
